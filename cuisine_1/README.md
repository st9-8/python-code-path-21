# Welcome to Cuisine 1 of Python-Code-Path 2021!

This repository will contain the coding works of students which are following the training on Python Programming Language in the program named **X-CODE-PATH**, organized by [SEED Enterprise](https://www.seeds.cm/).

# Folder organization

Each folder named like **cuisine_X** must contain the according **cuisine**, and in each **cuisine** folder the learners will deposit their work in folder named like **pypath_X** (X corresponding to the learner ID).

# What is the concept of Cuisine ?

After several weeks of knowledge acquisition and practical exercise on the basics of the Python programming language, learners should be assessed on their understanding of all these concepts. For this, a series of exercises is provided with the constraint of reaching a quota of points to pass the assessment. This assessment takes place over a specific number of days. 

These phases of the training are called **cuisine** (kitchens). After all the recipes that our chefs have learned, they now have to prepare the most delicious dishes for us.
